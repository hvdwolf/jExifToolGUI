# (Help) Translate jExifToolGUI into your own language

Download the program_strings.properties and program_help_texts.properties file to your computer from the folder translations in the main folder of this project.<br>
(Do not copy the ones from src/main/resources/translations. These will be generated and converted upon compile.)

Look at the  [Java 11 supported locales](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-suported-locales.html) page to see what your country locale is.

Please read the [translate](https://hvdwolf.github.io/jExifToolGUI/translate.html) webpage on how to do the translation, which options you have, and what rules you must follow.

If you think the translations are not correct, look at the top of the page to see who the translator is, and contact him/her.
